        <ol class="questions">
            <li><q>How did you get interested in CS?</q></li>
            <p>My degree is in Mathematics, and I was working on discrete math. Algorithmic questions are closely related, and I shifted to CS as CS has many exciting research questions and great research community. I learned about a lot of this during a postdoc in Berkeley.</p>

            <li><q>What is an accomplishment of which you're most proud?</q></li>

 
            <p>If I may mention two:<br>

              -The Algorithm Design textbook, that is used at many schools, and helped many students understand the importance of mathematical analysis of algorithms in CS<br>

              -Research I have done on the effect of selfish behavior on system outcome (called the Price of Anarchy)</p>

            <li><q>What advice would you give students who are on the fence about computing?</q></li>
            <p>CS is an exciting an very broad field with great opportunities in industry, in graduate schools, as well as many forms of interdisciplinary work. I originally majored in math, thinking of math a tool that will be useful in any field I may want to think about from social science to any of the classical sciences. CS is even better for this than math: a CS degree and CS knowledge opens doors to almost any field you may want to explore later in life.</p>

            <li><q>What is the coolest thing you've been able to do through CS?</q></li>
            <p>Become a university faculty member in the US, teach great students, get involved in many cool research.</p>

            <li><q>What are some of your non-CS interest or anything unique about you you'd like to share?</q></li>
            <p>I have a family with two kids, my younger one is finishing high school this year, both are intercollegiate soccer players. I grew up in Hungary, and my family is not CS or math people: My Dad was a MP in Hungary, and my Mom a child psychologist. At the moment itâ€™s hard to find time for things beside teaching/research and my family.</p>
