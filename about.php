      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p class="large">WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women in computing fields at Cornell, expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network of women, and empower them to encourage younger women to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding community for women and promote interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. By making women in computing fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, WICC fosters a support network to empower women and encourage young girls to discover their love for computing.</p>

          <p>Computer science is such a unique field where you can truly apply anything you learn in the classroom to any other area you can think of.  I have always loved math and science, and the idea that I can use these things to make a difference in the world is so exciting to me.  I think it's really important to encourage more people, both men and women, to pursue computer science by making the community more accepting and breaking many of the stereotypes associated with this field. Some interesting facts about myself: I speak Hungarian, love Thai food, and used to play the oboe!</p>

          <p>I came to college undecided, but after my first few classes I decided on CS. Functional programming (first semester sophomore year) really got me hooked and convinced me that I made the right choice! I like CS because it ranges from low-level up to web develop up to algorithm design -- it embodies so many different applications, but all with the same foundation of thinking hard and solving problems. Fun is a keyword.</p>

          <p>I didn't know a thing about computer science until I first developed my own cooking website to share my recipes with friends and family from around the world. It amazed me to see how typing in a different language could allow me to create websites, applications, games...the list goes on! Computer science has provided me with the opportunity to blend my passions with technology, and create an impact in the world. WICC has motivated and inspired me, and has given me a wonderful community of amazing female technologists who are willing to bring a change.</p>

          <p>The intro CS class I took my freshman year has changed my life. It made me fall in love with programming and exposed me to a world that refuses to release me from its grasp. I love the way coding challenges me to think and the possibilities it provides never ceases to amaze me. I originally declared CS as my major and though I have since switched, I am continuing to pursue my interests in the field. I definitely faced a lot of challenges trying to find my place in CS and that's one of the reasons I wanted to get involved with WICC. Having the right resources and support available is immensely valuable. WICC does an incredible job of providing that within a strong community and I am incredibly grateful to be a part of it.</p>

          <p>All through high school, I had no idea what to major in at the college level or what creer to pursue in my future. I did know however, that I was passionate about mathematics, physics, and helping others. I found myself going after an engineering degree and more specifically a Computer Science degree in order to bring all of these passions together. Still, I was anxious about Computer Science because of the various stereotypes that were present. WICC helped me learn that these stereotypes are meant to be broken and joining this organization freshman year empowered me to follow through with the major. I love that WICC brings together male and femae Computer Scince majors and I love contributing to this comraderie by directing social events. Just as Computer Science brings together so many skills, WICC brings together many unique people for a common purpose: to make Computer Scicne accessible to all.</p>

          <p>I came to Cornell not having a clue about how to program or even what Computer Science really was. After taking my first CS course, I knew I loved it. WICC has provided me with the much needed mentorship, and the opportunity to give back by guiding other girls in CS, and even girls in high school who have never been exposed to CS much like I was. On a larger scale, I was given the chance to help diminish stereotypes about women in the Computer Science field which I never could have done by myself.</p>

          <p>I discovered Computer Science in high school and found that it paired very well with my interest in Statistics, especially because modern data analysis is conducted in many programming languages and is dependent on complex algorithms. I was excited to pursue a double major in Computer Science and Statistics upon coming to Cornell, and was very happy to find many students through WICC who shared similar interests!  Cornell’s CS program has been a great way to expand my interests in CS to include software and web development and surely many other subfields within the next few years.  WICC is a wonderful group through which I’ve met lots of friendly and supportive CS students who are always willing to provide valuable advice.  Fun fact:  My favorite data structure is a hash map!</p>

          <p>I started CS when I was in seventh grade. I took a web design elective and instantly fell in love. I had tons of fun making little websites and finding all of the cool things I could do on a webpage with CSS. Since then I've taken lots of CS classes in high school and at Cornell and I've really enjoyed it. I still like doing web design, but now I also have a big interest in game design and plan to get a minor in it. A fun fact about me is that I lived in Australia for a year.</p>

          <p>From a very young age, I was captivated by anything related to computers or technology. But as I grew older and encountered new subjects, I easily became passionate about many of them: physics, art, mathematics, forensic science, law, and many more. Because all the subjects I loved were so diverse, I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up or a single passion that I wished to pursue. But recently, I realized that computer science is diverse and interdisciplinary enough to allow me to pursue everything I love to do. The way I see it, being a CS major is about communicating with machines via code to solve problems; and in the process, it enables ideas to evolve, to be shared, and be brought to life. I know that whether I study engineering, physical sciences, art, or even the humanities, there will definitely be an opportunity to apply my skills and interest in computer science. </p>

          <p>I came into CS from a completely artistic point of view. During the last three years of high school, I spent most of my free time exploring various types of digital artwork. I started with paintings, moved into graphic design, and then one day stumbled across web design which utterly capivated me like nothing ever had before. I loved the artistic, front-end side of websites, but then steadily became more interested in the programming aspects of how websites actually do the things they do. These days, I enjoy building beautiful, functional websites as well as learning more about CS in my classes.</p>
