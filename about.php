                <h3>Co-President</h3>
                <p>Computer science is such a unique field where you can truly apply anything you learn in the classroom to any other area you can think of.  I have always loved math and science, and the idea that I can use these things to make a difference in the world is so exciting to me.  I think it's really important to encourage more people, both men and women, to pursue computer science by making the community more accepting and breaking many of the stereotypes associated with this field. Some interesting facts about myself: I speak Hungarian, love Thai food, and used to play the oboe!</p>

              <p>I came to college undecided, but after my first few classes I decided on CS. Functional programming (first semester sophomore year) really got me hooked and convinced me that I made the right choice! I like CS because it ranges from low-level up to web develop up to algorithm design -- it embodies so many different applications, but all with the same foundation of thinking hard and solving problems. Fun is a keyword.</p>

              <p>It was almost by chance that I landed into Information Science and CS. In high school, I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do. I had a very mixed set of classes, definitely not all STEM so I never had this deeply rooted sense of commitment when it came to perhaps picking a STEM major in college. In senior year I decided to take AP Computer Science on a whim, knowing that it was not rigorously taught at my high school. However, I found myself becoming almost addicted to the mindset of a problem solver, from tiring analysis to utter frustration to ultimate satisfaction in the end. I didn't fall in love with computer science after compiling "Hello World!", though that's a nice anecdote. It took me an entire semester to realize that this may be something I want to pursue in college. As an information science major, I feel especially connected to idea of not being a programmer but being a problem solver and I love the scope Information Science provides in order to play that role. Through design, product strategy, and development I feel I can handle solving real problems in life through technology or at least design thinking. My ability to do this makes me happy that I chose the path that I did, and never once looked back. </p>

              <p>I spent most of high school pretty undecided about what to pursue in college. I had always liked art, but never seriously considered it as a career path because I didn't want to give up my interest in math and science. When I realized my passion for art stemed from the creativity and problem solving needed to bring my ideas to life, I knew that I would pursue engineering because it involved everything I loved about art and allowed me to futher my studies in science. Computer Science, in particular, allows me to put these passions to work to solve nearly any problem that we face today, in any feild imaginable! </p>

              <p>I have always been a strong math and science student, but I had never coded before coming to Cornell. I initially took Python to fullfill a core requirement in the College of Engineering and was suprised by how quickly I fell in love with the subject. I love how CS has enabled me to build the most intricate and elaborate projects using the most fundamental structures and algorithms, but I would have to say my favorite part about my major is how supportive all of my professors, course stafff, and classmates have been. I joined WICC at the beginning of my junior year. I am so happy to have found a community of incredibly talented women within my major, and I can't imagine surviving college without all of their guidance and support.</p>

              <h3>Outreach Co-Director</h3>
              <p>In high school, I joined a programming club on a whim. I learned C++ and went to competitions with my friends. It was, by far, the most fun thing I'd ever done at school. By the end of junior year, I knew I wanted to major in CS some day. I took two CS classes at Worcester Polytech before graduating high school and coming to Cornell. I don't remember exactly when I became aware that women were underrepresented in CS. Perhaps it was the weird feeling I got at high school competitions, or the little comments I'd hear in college, or the articles I'd read online. As an avid gamer who grew up playing N64 with my brother and father, I constantly wonder how my upbringing has affected my interest in science and technology. By my freshman year, I was well aware of the gender disparities and looking to inspire young women like me. I taught for a Girls Who Code 8-week coding summer camp and currently teach for the LearnCS High School program with WiCC. </p>

It wasn't until I got to Cornell where I was able to take interesting CS classes and was exposed to many opportunities around campus including tech talks and workshops. I am excited to gain more experience and even more excited to share them with younger girls (and guys) from this local area that I grew up in. I hope that our outreach program can be a stepping stone for many students out there!</p>

              <p>My frist experience with computer science was when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time, my friends and I decided to learn Python by ourselves because we wanted to start a company together. As you can see by my lack of fame and fortune, we never actually started a company. However, the venture was not a total failure because we all found a love for computer science. When I applied to Cornell, I knew I wanted to be a CS major and I haven't regretted my decision since. After coming to Cornell, I was thankful to find such a great and supportive community in WICC. The WICC community is composed of some truly inspiring people and I am proud to be a part of it. Fun fact: My friends and I named our hypothetical company, The Company. I know, we were clever.</p>

              <p>A professor once told me that engineers build the plane computer scientists pilot. But, I was interested in both building and developing. Cornell gives me the opportunity to do both while also collaborating with people in various fields. WICC gives me the opportunity to do the same but on a higher level – I get to have conversations and engage with engineering/CS people while learning and organizing events that help us learn more and prepare us for our futures. Moreover, WICC extends this sort of collaboration and opens doors for women, specifically, who are interested in technology, and I think that forcing focused discussions can help expose underlying discrimination that occurs in tech – a reason I chose to join WICC and come to Cornell (yay for almost 50% girls in engineering!). Fun fact: At least thirty people have asked me if I’m a CS major and gasp when I say I’m not</p>

I did know however, that I was passionate about mathematics, physics, and helping others. I found myself going after an engineering degree and more specifically a Computer Science degree in order to bring all of these passions together. Still, I was anxious about Computer Science because of the various stereotypes that were present. WICC helped me learn that these stereotypes are meant to be broken and joining this organization freshman year empowered me to follow through with the major. I love that WICC brings together male and female Computer Scince majors and I love contributing to this comraderie by directing social events. Just as Computer Science brings together so many skills, WICC brings together many unique people for a common purpose: to make Computer Scicne accessible to all.</p>

After noticing some users had really awesome looking shops with colorful backgrounds, images, and soundtracks, I googled how to make my shop like that, which introduced me to HTML and CSS. I still had no idea what I wanted to study in college, but I knew I liked math, and I had seen the applicable nature of CS at an early age. I decided on Computer Science intially because I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew CS would offer me lots of options since technology is relevant for every company! I am new to the WICC board, but I have loved participating in events previous semesters.

              <h3>Outreach Co-Director</h3>
              <p>I started CS when I was in seventh grade. I took a web design elective and instantly fell in love. I had tons of fun making little websites and finding all of the cool things I could do on a webpage with CSS. Since then I've taken lots of CS classes in high school and at Cornell and I've really enjoyed it. I still like doing web design, but now I also have a big interest in game design and plan to get a minor in it. A fun fact about me is that I lived in Australia for a year.</p>

              <h3>Alumni Relations Director</h3>
              <p> My first exposure to CS came in the form of a required intro to MATLAB class my freshman year. It introduced me to a style of algorithmic thinking and creative problem solving that I had not practiced in any other discipline and I found it intensely rewarding. I initially joined WICC because I wanted to make friends with those who were hardcore enough to pursue such a rigorous major, and I began as a volunteer for the LearnCS outreach program. As I have gotten to know the wonderful ladies in WICC and Girls Who Code, I've discovered that CS really isn't such a scary field after all, and is truly open to all who are interested. This upcoming semester, I will be working to expand WICC's alumni network and connecting current undergraduates with mentors who have experience in industry. </p>

              <h3>Design and Publications Director</h3>
              <p>I coded for the first time in high school, through the introductory Java course which I enrolled in for kicks and because I had room in my schedule. After that, I dove head first into the tech industry and wanted to know and learn more. I decided to major in Information Science because of my interest in product design, user experience, and digital media!</p>

              <h3>Website Co-Director</h3>
              <p>From a very young age, I was captivated by anything related to computers or technology. But as I grew older and encountered new subjects, I easily became passionate about many of them: physics, art, mathematics, forensic science, law, and many more. Because all the subjects I loved were so diverse, I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up or a single passion that I wished to pursue. But recently, I realized that computer science is diverse and interdisciplinary enough to allow me to pursue everything I love to do. The way I see it, being a CS major is about communicating with machines via code to solve problems; and in the process, it enables ideas to evolve, to be shared, and be brought to life. I know that whether I study engineering, physical sciences, art, or even the humanities, there will definitely be an opportunity to apply my skills and interest in computer science.</p>

              <h3>Website Co-Director</h3>
              <p>I came into CS from a completely artistic point of view. During the last three years of high school, I spent most of my free time exploring various types of digital artwork. I started with paintings, moved into graphic design, and then one day stumbled across web design which utterly capivated me like nothing ever had before. I loved the artistic, front-end side of websites, but then steadily became more interested in the programming aspects of how websites actually do the things they do. These days, I enjoy building beautiful, functional websites as well as learning more about CS in my classes.</p>
