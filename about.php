          <h1>History</h1>

          <p class="large">WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women in computing fields at Cornell, expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network of women, and empower them to encourage younger women to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding community for women and promote interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. By making women in computing fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, WICC fosters a support network to empower women and encourage young girls to discover their love for computing.</p>

          <p>Computer science is such a unique field where you can truly apply anything you learn in the classroom to any other area you can think of.  I have always loved math and science, and the idea that I can use these things to make a difference in the world is so exciting to me.  I think it's really important to encourage more people, both men and women, to pursue computer science by making the community more accepting and breaking many of the stereotypes associated with this field. Some interesting facts about myself: I speak Hungarian, love Thai food, and used to play the oboe!</p>

          <p>I came to college undecided, but after my first few classes I decided on CS. Functional programming (first semester sophomore year) really got me hooked and convinced me that I made the right choice! I like CS because it ranges from low-level up to web develop up to algorithm design -- it embodies so many different applications, but all with the same foundation of thinking hard and solving problems. Fun is a keyword.</p>

          <p>I have always been a strong math and science student, but I had never coded before coming to Cornell. I initially took Python to fullfill a core requirement in the College of Engineering and was suprised by how quickly I fell in love with the subject. I love how CS has enabled me to build the most intricate and elaborate projects using the most fundamental structures and algorithms, but I would have to say my favorite part about my major is how supportive all of my professors, course stafff, and classmates have been. I joined WICC at the beginning of my junior year. I am so happy to have found a community of incredibly talented women within my major, and I can't imagine surviving college without all of their guidance and support.</p>

          <p>In high school, I joined a programming club on a whim. I learned C++ and went to competitions with my friends. It was, by far, the most fun thing I'd ever done at school. By the end of junior year, I knew I wanted to major in CS some day. I took two CS classes at Worcester Polytech before graduating high school and coming to Cornell. I don't remember exactly when I became aware that women were underrepresented in CS. Perhaps it was the weird feeling I got at high school competitions, or the little comments I'd hear in college, or the articles I'd read online. As an avid gamer who grew up playing N64 with my brother and father, I constantly wonder how my upbringing has affected my interest in science and technology. By my freshman year, I was well aware of the gender disparities and looking to inspire young women like me. I taught for a Girls Who Code 8-week coding summer camp and currently teach for the LearnCS High School program with WiCC. </p>

It wasn't until I got to Cornell where I was able to take interesting CS classes and was exposed to many opportunities around campus including tech talks and workshops. I am excited to gain more experience and even more excited to share them with younger girls (and guys) from this local area that I grew up in. I hope that our outreach program can be a stepping stone for many students out there!</p>

          <p>My frist experience with computer science was when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time, my friends and I decided to learn Python by ourselves because we wanted to start a company together. As you can see by my lack of fame and fortune, we never actually started a company. However, the venture was not a total failure because we all found a love for computer science. When I applied to Cornell, I knew I wanted to be a CS major and I haven't regretted my decision since. After coming to Cornell, I was thankful to find such a great and supportive community in WICC. The WICC community is composed of some truly inspiring people and I am proud to be a part of it. Fun fact: My friends and I named our hypothetical company, The Company. I know, we were clever.</p>

          <p>A professor once told me that engineers build the plane computer scientists pilot. But, I was interested in both building and developing. Cornell gives me the opportunity to do both while also collaborating with people in various fields. WICC gives me the opportunity to do the same but on a higher level – I get to have conversations and engage with engineering/CS people while learning and organizing events that help us learn more and prepare us for our futures. Moreover, WICC extends this sort of collaboration and opens doors for women, specifically, who are interested in technology, and I think that forcing focused discussions can help expose underlying discrimination that occurs in tech – a reason I chose to join WICC and come to Cornell (yay for almost 50% girls in engineering!). Fun fact: At least thirty people have asked me if I’m a CS major and gasp when I say I’m not</p>

          <p>All through high school, I had no idea what to major in at the college level or what creer to pursue in my future. I did know however, that I was passionate about mathematics, physics, and helping others. I found myself going after an engineering degree and more specifically a Computer Science degree in order to bring all of these passions together. Still, I was anxious about Computer Science because of the various stereotypes that were present. WICC helped me learn that these stereotypes are meant to be broken and joining this organization freshman year empowered me to follow through with the major. I love that WICC brings together male and female Computer Scince majors and I love contributing to this comraderie by directing social events. Just as Computer Science brings together so many skills, WICC brings together many unique people for a common purpose: to make Computer Scicne accessible to all.</p>

As WICC’s Faculty Relations Director, I hope to strengthen the relationships between students and faculty so that students get the most out of their Cornell experience. I have personally gained so much from interacting closely with my faculty advisor and by conducting research under another Cornell professor and I want to enable my fellow Cornell students to do the same!</p>

          <p>I spent most of high school pretty undecided about what to pursue in college. I had always liked art, but never seriously considered it as a career path because I didn't want to give up my interest in math and science. When I realized my passion for art stemed from the creativity and problem solving needed to bring my ideas to life, I knew that I would pursue engineering because it involved everything I loved about art and allowed me to futher my studies in science. Computer Science, in particular, allows me to put these passions to work to solve nearly any problem that we face today, in any feild imaginable! </p>

          <p>When I was in elementary school and middle school I was obsessed with Neopets. Neopets has a shop feature where you can sell certain neopet items for neopoints. After noticing some users had really awesome looking shops with colorful backgrounds, images, and soundtracks, I googled how to make my shop like that, which introduced me to HTML and CSS. I still had no idea what I wanted to study in college, but I knew I liked math, and I had seen the applicable nature of CS at an early age. I decided on Computer Science intially because I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew CS would offer me lots of options since technology is relevant for every company! I am new to the WICC board, but I have loved participating in events previous semesters. Fun Fact: I got open water certified in scuba diving this summer, and I scuba dived the Great Barrier Reef over winter break!</p>

          <p> My first exposure to CS came in the form of a required intro to MATLAB class my freshman year. It introduced me to a style of algorithmic thinking and creative problem solving that I had not practiced in any other discipline and I found it intensely rewarding. I initially joined WICC because I wanted to make friends with those who were hardcore enough to pursue such a rigorous major, and I began as a volunteer for the LearnCS outreach program. As I have gotten to know the wonderful ladies in WICC and Girls Who Code, I've discovered that CS really isn't such a scary field after all, and is truly open to all who are interested. This upcoming semester, I will be working to expand WICC's alumni network and connecting current undergraduates with mentors who have experience in industry. </p>

          <p>From a very young age, I was captivated by anything related to computers or technology. But as I grew older and encountered new subjects, I easily became passionate about many of them: physics, art, mathematics, forensic science, law, and many more. Because all the subjects I loved were so diverse, I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up or a single passion that I wished to pursue. But recently, I realized that computer science is diverse and interdisciplinary enough to allow me to pursue everything I love to do. The way I see it, being a CS major is about communicating with machines via code to solve problems; and in the process, it enables ideas to evolve, to be shared, and be brought to life. I know that whether I study engineering, physical sciences, art, or even the humanities, there will definitely be an opportunity to apply my skills and interest in computer science.</p>

          <p>I came into CS from a completely artistic point of view. During the last three years of high school, I spent most of my free time exploring various types of digital artwork. I started with paintings, moved into graphic design, and then one day stumbled across web design which utterly capivated me like nothing ever had before. I loved the artistic, front-end side of websites, but then steadily became more interested in the programming aspects of how websites actually do the things they do. These days, I enjoy building beautiful, functional websites as well as learning more about CS in my classes.</p>
