        <h1>Mentorship</h1>

        <p>Our mentorship program strives to encourage and aid women who are pursuing studies or future employment 
          in computing by connecting female undergraduates with more experienced upperclassmen and alumni 
          mentors. The role of the mentor is to cultivate and enhance their mentees' interest in computer 
          science.</p>

          <p>Mentors and mentees will be matched primarily based on academic interests. Mentees can also 
          request mentors, and we will do our best to honor these requests.</p>

              <h2>Become a Mentor</h2>
              <p>As a mentor you are expected to hold conversations with your mentee monthly, help your mentee 
            establish meaningful connections, give her advice on course selection, or otherwise. Any 
            motivated undergraduates, graduate students, and grads majoring in or working CS or related 
            technical fields can sign-up as a mentor.</p>
